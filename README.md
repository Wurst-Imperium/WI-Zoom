# WI Zoom (Wurst-Imperium Zoom)

WI Zoom is the zoom from the [Wurst Client](https://www.wurstclient.net/) as a standalone Minecraft mod, letting you zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and providing up to 50x magnification without the need for a spyglass. This mod is fully compatible with OptiFine and Sodium, but unlike OptiFine's zoom, WI Zoom lets the camera move in a logical way, without making it wobble around. WI Zoom supports all of the latest Minecraft versions, including snapshots.

## Development Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have [Java Development Kit 21](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk21&jvmVariant=hotspot) installed. It won't work with other versions.

### Development using Eclipse

1. Clone the repository:

   ```pwsh
   git clone https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WI-Zoom.git
   cd WI-Zoom
   ```

2. Generate the sources:

   In Fabric versions:
   ```pwsh
   ./gradlew genSources eclipse
   ```

   In NeoForge versions:
   ```pwsh
   ./gradlew eclipse
   ```

3. In Eclipse, go to `Import...` > `Existing Projects into Workspace` and select this project.

4. **Optional:** Right-click on the project and select `Properties` > `Java Code Style`. Then under `Clean Up`, `Code Templates`, `Formatter`, import the respective files in the `codestyle` folder.

### Development using VSCode / Cursor

> [!TIP]
> You'll probably want to install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) to make development easier.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```pwsh
   git clone https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WI-Zoom.git
   cd WI-Zoom
   ```

2. Generate the sources:

   In Fabric versions:
   ```pwsh
   ./gradlew genSources vscode
   ```

   In NeoForge versions:
   ```pwsh
   ./gradlew eclipse
   ```
   (That's not a typo. NeoForge doesn't have `vscode`, but `eclipse` works fine.)

3. Open the `WI-Zoom` folder in VSCode / Cursor.

4. **Optional:** In the VSCode settings, set `java.format.settings.url` to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wurst-Imperium/WI-Zoom/master/codestyle/formatter.xml` and `java.format.settings.profile` to `Wurst-Imperium`.

### Development using IntelliJ IDEA

I don't use or recommend IntelliJ, but the commands to run would be:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WI-Zoom.git
cd WI-Zoom
./gradlew genSources idea
```
